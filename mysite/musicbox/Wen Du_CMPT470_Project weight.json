  "comments": "The reason I gave Yuchen a very low points is because she contribute too little to the project. She only showed up twice in our meetings, we lose marks because she did not push her code to gitLab before project checkpoint. And all the code she wrote does not work and caused compatible issues. Zhi as our project manager did not play his part, his attitude towards our project is poor and that is the main reason I gave 15 points."
